* scanaerial
 - Scan for areas of similar colour on aerial pictures like OCR for text.
 - recognition works well with lakes, however it will not produce good results with
   wood in near future.

* Features/Changelog

** 3.0 2023-04-02
 - Python 3 migration thanks to taranarmo
 - Code clean up thanks to taranarmo

** 2.1-beta-1
 - Bing support merged in. Thanks to Cybjit and IrlJidel
 - Improved TMS support ({-y} and {switch:} options added)
 - Timeout check replaced by size limit feature: now it is possible to trace rivers
 - Tags settings moved to configuration file
 - Fixed bugs in Douglas-Peucker algorithm
 - Detection of empty tiles added

** 2.0-beta.1
 - TMS support added, new timeout check. Thanks to Vort

** 1.0.3
 - malenki et al. reported that latlon.org does not work at the moment/anymore (?)
   geoposer.com is another bing WMS server, but somone has to figure out how to use it with scanaerial.
   Till then it is possible to use landsat with
   wms_server_url = http://irs.gis-lab.info/?layers=landsat&

** 1.0.2
 - added tag source:zoomlevel. You see sometimes very different details
   in different zoomlevels.

** 1.0.1
 - inner and outer Multipolygon work

** 1.0.0
 - TMS Zoomlevel of JOSM is used for the downloaded WMS Tiles
 - scanaerial works with Ext_tools Plugin

* Requirements
 - JOSM
 - Python. You can run library_check.py to find out if a library is missing
 - Ext_tools plug-in for JOSM.
   {TZoom} is part of Ext_tools since Ext_tools 25274
 - Of course you need the scanaerial files too.
   You will find the latest releases on
   [[https://github.com/jonasstein/scanaerial/archives/master]]
   Copy them to JOSM/plugins/scanaerial for example.

* Setup
 - unzip the contents of the downloaded archive to the JOSM plugin directory
   Linux users put it to: ~/.josm/plugins/ext_tools/scanaerial
 - start JOSM, press F12 and go to Ext_tools configuration
 - use this cmdline:/home/<username>/.josm/plugins/ext_tools/scanaerial/scanaerial.py {lat} {lon} {TZoom}
   It will create a new menu item in JOSM. (NB: Syntax may change soon)
   Due to a bug in Ext_tools you can not write "~" instead of "home"
 - For best result you may finetune the values in scanaerial.cfg

 | key                     | function                                                  |
 |-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
 | fixedzoomlevel          | use this zoomlevel, if Ext_tools did not tell via TZoom   |
 | server_api              | access method of map server: wms, tms or bing             |
 | server_name             | name of the map server (only for the tag string)          |
 | server_url              | half-link for WMS, JOSM-like address for TMS              |
 | empty_tile_bytes        | size of empty tile (in bytes) for current map server      |
 | empty_tile_checksum     | checksum of empty tile file (algorithm: CRC32)            |
 | projection              | projection that is used on the map server                 |
 | tile_sizex,-y           | leave it to 256 unless you know what you do               |
 | douglas_peucker_epsilon | maximum roughness for smoothening the line                |
 | deactivate_simplifying  | deactivate Douglas-Peucker algorithm (only for debugging) |
 | colour_str              | colour sensitivity (depends on contrast of images)        |
 | maxfilter_setting       | median filter size (noise reduction strength)             |
 | size_limit              | maximum size of produced object                           |

* Roadmap
 - collect recipies for better algorithms
 - try to exclude douglas-peucker from scanaerial. josm can do that.
 - try different algorithms in forks and compare them.
 - try to access cached wms tiles from josm
 - rewrite in c(++) and/or java
 - find betatester
* Troubleshooting
 - if anything fails have a look on the error console.
   Scanaerial is very verbous.
